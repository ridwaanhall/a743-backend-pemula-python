# API Test collections

This repository contains two main API test collections and their respective environments using Postman:

- **NotesAPITestCollectionAndEnvironment**: This collection includes tests for the Notes API, ensuring that all endpoints function correctly and as expected.
- **OpenShopAPITestCollectionAndEnvironment**: This collection includes tests for the Open Shop API, verifying the proper operation of its endpoints.

These collections are essential for maintaining the reliability and performance of the APIs.
